Final Project for INFO 5312

Project Title: The Interplay Between Inflation and Unemployment
Team Members: Clayton Seibel
Project Description: This project aims to explore the relationship between the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Unemployment Rates over the past two decades in the United States. Given the economic theory of the Phillips Curve, which hypothesizes an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment, my interactive article will allow users to visually engage with the data to understand how these metrics have interacted over time.
Intended Audience: The primary audience for this project includes students, economic enthusiasts, and policy makers interested in understanding macroeconomic forces.
Project Goals:
•	To visualize the correlation between CPI and Unemployment Rates from 2000 to 2023.
•	To provide an interactive tool that allows users to explore data trends over time and across different economic cycles.
•	To educate the audience on how economic policies might influence these indicators.
Data Sources:
•	CPI data sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
•	Unemployment rate data sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Visualization and Interactivity Description:
1.	Interactive Time Series Graph: A dual-axis time series graph where users can view both CPI and unemployment rates over time. Users can select specific time frames, view tooltips for data points, and see annotations for major economic events.
2.	Geographic Plot: An interactive GeoJSON of USA plot displaying CPI and unemployment rates with a heatmap. Trends can be broken down geographically.
